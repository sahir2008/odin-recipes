      Gnocchi is simple to make with just three ingredients: mashed potato,
      flour, and egg. This recipe is one my family has used for generations.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Gnocchi (singular gnocchi) are Italian dumplings made with flour, eggs, and
      potatoes. Gnocchi can be served in tomato sauce, tossed with pesto, or
      saut√©ed with butter and herbs.

      "Gnocchi" can be difficult to pronounce for native English speakers. For
      future reference, gnocchi is pronounced NYOW-kee.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; add potatoes and cook until 
            tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool, and mash with a fork 
            or potato masher.</li>
        <li>Combine 1 cup mashed potato, flour, and egg in a large bowl. Knead until dough
             forms a ball. Shape small portions of the dough into long "snakes". On a floured
              surface, cut snakes into 1/2-inch pieces.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Drop in gnocchi and cook for
             3 to 5 minutes or until gnocchi have risen to the top; drain and serve.</li>
