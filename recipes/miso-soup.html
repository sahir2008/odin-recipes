        This miso soup is full of savory flavors. Add more dashy to your soup 
        if you want a stronger stock. You can use yellow, white, or red miso paste 
        for this soup — yellow miso is sweet and creamy, red miso is stronger and saltier.

        Miso soup is a traditional Japanese soup that starts with a dashi stock and is flavored with miso paste. Dashi is an umami-rich stock made from dried seaweed and dried fish. Miso paste, meanwhile, is a paste made from soybeans, salt, and koji rice.
